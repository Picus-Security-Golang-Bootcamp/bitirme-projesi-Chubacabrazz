# E-Commerce App in GOLANG
( Development of App incomplete due to illness =( , I will complete it when i have time )

### Build with Go. Used Gorm , PostgreSQL , Godotenv , JWT , Viper . Also used Postman.

This is a basket app for basic usage. It has products and product categories which people register then do shopping.



For checking APIs, I used Postman. For use your url should look like <yourHost>/api/v1/picus-storeApp/


### App has multiple endpoints to communicate, /user /cart /category etc.
